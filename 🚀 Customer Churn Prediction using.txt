🚀 Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression

I recently worked on a Machine Learning Project where I built a model to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the company) or stay, using a telecom dataset.

🔑 Project Steps:

1️⃣ Data Loading & EDA

Loaded CSV dataset with customer details.

Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) → shape, summary stats, null values, duplicates.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in Age, Tenure, MonthlyCharges.

Removed duplicates for data quality.

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Converted categorical features (like Gender) into numeric using Label Encoding.

Selected input features → Gender, Age, Tenure, MonthlyCharges.

Target variable → Churn.

4️⃣ Feature Scaling

Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature values.

5️⃣ Model Training

Used Logistic Regression for binary classification (Churn = Yes/No).

Split dataset into train (80%) and test (20%).

6️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy Score ✅

Precision Score ✅

Log Loss (measures prediction probabilities).

Created Actual vs Predicted visualization.

7️⃣ Results

Accuracy: ~📊 (insert your score here).

Precision: ~📊 (insert your score here).

Log Loss: ~📊 (insert your score here).

8️⃣ Model Saving

Saved model using Joblib → customer_churn.pkl.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, log_loss)
Joblib for model persistence
